### Project: Spend n Split

Spend n Split (SnS) is a **desktop app for managing expense from contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a transaction
  * This allows the user to add a transaction in the application.
  * Pull requests: Add addTransaction command [[PR#82]]
* **New Feature**: Added the telegramHandle attribute for the Person class.
  * This allows the user to provide a telegram handle for each person in the application.
