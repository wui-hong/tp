### Project: Spend n Split

Spend n Split (SnS) is a **desktop app for managing expense from contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, SnS can get your contact expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
